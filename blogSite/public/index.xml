      <description>This program touches on networking. It lets two players play a game of ConnectFour while the program keeps track of the baord. The server and client was setup as follows:
public ConnectFourServer(int port) throws IOException { server = new ServerSocket(port); //connections for both players s1 = server.accept(); s2 = server.accept(); //input and output streams for both out1 = new PrintStream(s1.getOutputStream()); in1 = new Scanner(s1.getInputStream()); out2 = new PrintStream(s2.getOutputStream()); in2 = new Scanner(s2.</description>

      <description>This project deals with Calculus expressions. The program is designed to solve certain type of problems. The abstract class, Function.java was used as a template for math objects such as a sum, project, cosine, variable, etc. :
public abstract class Function { /** * Create a function */ public Function() { } public abstract double evaluate(double x); public abstract String toString(); public abstract Function derivative(); public abstract double integral(double a, double b, int c); public abstract boolean isConstant(); }  One of the more difficult parts of this was implementing the derivative function of a Product object.</description>

      <description>This exercise was used to evaluate simple mathematical expressions that were represented by a tree. The following classes were used to help make the tree:
@dataclass class LiteralNode: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Represents an operand node&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; val: int @dataclass class VariableNode: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Represents a variable node&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; name: str @dataclass class MathNode: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Represents a mathematical operation&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; left: Union[&#39;MathNode&#39;, LiteralNode, VariableNode] op: str right: Union[&#39;MathNode&#39;, LiteralNode, VariableNode] @dataclass class table: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; used to store variables with their value &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; key: str value: str  Using those, a method was made to solve the equations:</description>

      <description>This is one of the earliest programming exercises I had worked on: Given 3 parameters, a function would return how many roots an equation had and what they were.
Sample Code:
def quadratic_roots(a, b, c): &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; This function will take the discriminant and use it to see how many roots exist for the equation. It then finds what the roots are. The a, b, c variables pertain to the a,b,c in the equation ax^2 + bx + c.</description>

      <description>Started practicing this in my first year of college to better apreciate music. I figured if I learned a musical instrument, I would be able to understand beats/rhytmn more and how they work together.</description>
